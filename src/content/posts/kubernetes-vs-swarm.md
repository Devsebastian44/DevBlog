Container orchestration is more important than ever. While Kubernetes is the industry standard, Docker Swarm still has a place for many teams.

## The Case for Kubernetes
Kubernetes (K8s) offers unparalleled scaling, self-healing, and a massive ecosystem of tools like Helm and Prometheus.

## Why Docker Swarm Still Matters
For small teams or projects that don't need complex service meshes, Docker Swarm provides a much lower barrier to entry.

## Making the Choice in 2024
We compare both based on cost, complexity, and future-proofing your infrastructure.
