The transition from ETL to ELT has fundamentally changed how data engineers work. In this article, we'll explore why this shift happened and what it means for your data stack.

## The Shift from ETL to ELT
In the past, data was transformed before being loaded into the warehouse. Today, cloud warehouses like Snowflake are powerful enough to handle transformations on the fly.

## Role of dbt and Data Versioning
Tools like dbt (data build tool) allow engineers to write transformations in SQL while maintaining version control and documentation.

## Conclusion: Is ETL Dead?
While ELT is dominant, ETL still has its place for specific streaming and high-security use cases.
